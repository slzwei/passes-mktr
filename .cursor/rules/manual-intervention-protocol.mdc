# Manual Intervention Rule 

Only prompt for manual intervention when: 
- Apple Developer certificates need to be generated/configured 
- Specific business logic decisions require user input 
- External API keys or credentials need to be provided 
- Design preferences that cannot be inferred from context 

For everything else, make intelligent decisions and implement fully.
